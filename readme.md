Open project3_stereovision.py file.

It prompts you to enter the data set number with '1' being for curule, '2' for octagon and '3' for pendulum.

Please change the rescale value from 0.5 to 1 when checking for pendulum since for some reason the homography matrix becomes singular in former case and thus we would be unable to calculate inverse matrix.

Thanks to my clumpsy writing, the code takes a long time to calculate disparity and depth. So sit back and relax or go grab a cup of coffee in mean time :D.
